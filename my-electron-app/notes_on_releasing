Use following to install electron-packager locally.
    npm install electron-packager --save-dev

Use following to create distributable with source code unhidden, with name SystemGenerator
    npx electron-packager . SystemGenerator

Following does better at hidding, but requires JScrambler to really be harder to read.
    npx electron-packager . SystemGenerator --asar --out ./releases/
